# Neural Network Charity Analysis

# OVERVIEW
Deep learning has provided successful classifiers in many fields.

We would like to find out if a deep network could be used to help create a classifier that will pedict with at least a 75% level of accuracy if a future project we fund will be successful

We will use our exising in house charity data csv file

# RESULTS

## Data Preprocessing
- Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL
- Features: NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, ASK_AMOUNT
- Dropped Columns: EIN, STATUS, AFFILIATION, USE_CASE_SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

## Compiling, Training and Evaluation

Per my notebook I tried lots of things but I never got above 75%

# SUMMARY

I need to probably find out how to do this better.
